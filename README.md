# Spotify Clone

This is a simple Spotify clone created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project aims to mimic the user interface and functionality of Spotify, allowing users to browse music, play tracks, and interact with a basic music player interface. It is designed for educational purposes and as a fun project to practice web development skills.

## Features

- Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
- Simulated music player with play, pause, and track navigation controls.
- Static music list (can be extended to pull from a real music API).
- Simple user interface with album art, track names, and artist information.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the web pages, including elements for the music player and navigation.
- **CSS**: Styling of the pages and layout, including hover effects and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Adding interactive behavior to the music player, like playing and pausing tracks, navigating between songs, etc.
